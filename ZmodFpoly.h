   ZmodFpoly_t
   -----------

ZmodFpoly_t represents a polynomial with coefficients in Z/pZ, where
p = B^n + 1, B = 2^FLINT_BITS_PER_LIMB. Coefficients are represented in the
format described in ZmodFermat.h.

Each polynomial has a fixed transform length 2^depth, specified at creation
time, where depth >= 0.

A polynomial may be in either "coefficient representation" (list of
coefficients of the polynomial), or "fourier representation" (list of
fourier coefficients). The polynomial does not keep track of which form it
is in, this is just a conceptual distinction.

x.length indicates how many coefficients contain meaningful data. If x is in
coefficient representation, the remaining coefficients are assumed to be
*zero*. If x is in fourier representation, the remaining coefficients are not
necessarily zero, they are simply *unknown*.

Always 0 <= length <= 2^depth.

Each polynomial carries a number of additional scratch buffers. The number of
scratch buffers is set at creation time. Various routines require a certain
number of scratch buffers to be present. The scratch buffers and coefficient
buffers are allocated as one large block, and routines may *permute* them,
so that outputs may well end up in what was originally a scratch buffer.
